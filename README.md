# Pronunciation Game: Vowel sounds /i:/

This game is designed for students of English to practice pronunciation sounds by word spellings /i:/ i.e. tree, bee, he, me, she...
It differentiates between /i:/ 'be' and other vowel sounds: /I/ 'ship', /ɪə/ 'ear', /e/ 'egg', /aɪ/ 'eye', /eɪ/ 'hate'.
This is often a difficult aspect of reading and speaking in English as the spellings of words are often misleading.
Some students, esp. Spanish language speakers, find it difficult to hear the difference between /I/ and /i:/, and so this game provides some further practice
with reference to spelling differences alongside sound differentiation, eg. 'ship' and 'sheep'.

Future development:
- I intend to add in sounds, with a pron demonstration at the beginning and interractive spellings which can be clicked to hear the correct pronunciation.
- A page which details the mouth shapes required to make the different sounds & interractive phonemic chart.
- More games with different phonemes!
- A phonemic spelling tool.

This game was made with js guidance from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k
The questions were inspired by and adapted from 'Simple Sound Maze Puzzle 1 /i:/' from Pronunciation Games by Mark Hancock.
